Some of you may remember a while ago, Forestry released a field type for its editor called Blocks that can be used to create page layouts from predefined components (among other things.) I released a Hugo theme accompanying this feature called **Sawmill 29** that showed you how to use Blocks in this way.  Last week, I worked with our Creative Director to make a theme called uBuild for Jekyll. This week I ported that theme over to Hugo, and wanted to take some time to talk about a few strategies I’ve stumbled across for using the Blocks feature effectively. I really want to encourage anyone using Forestry to explore what’s possible with different field combinations, and to take Blocks into their own hands to make cool stuff.
